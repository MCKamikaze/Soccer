Another project I've done while studying OOP, it's an unfinished soccer game done using GUI.
One of the players could be controlled by the user and the other mainly chases the ball.
By clicking anywhere on the field you can reset the ball's position with its current momentum.
It lacks the actual rules of the game (scoring a goal for instance) and a decent AI, but the layout of the field is nice and it's a good demonstration of how easy it is to draw something more advanced using java and the paintcomponent.
